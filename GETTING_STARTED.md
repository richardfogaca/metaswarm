# Getting Started

This guide walks you through your first metaswarm-orchestrated workflow.

## Step 1: Install metaswarm

Choose your platform:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude plugin marketplace add richardfogaca/metaswarm
claude plugin install metaswarm@richardfogaca-tools
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
gemini extensions install https://github.com/richardfogaca/metaswarm.git
```

**Codex CLI:**
```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardfogaca/metaswarm/main/.codex/install.sh | bash
```

**All platforms at once:**
```bash
npx metaswarm init
```

Then run setup in your project:
- Claude Code: `/setup`
- Gemini CLI: `/metaswarm:setup`
- Codex CLI: `$setup`

The setup skill detects your project's language, framework, test runner, and tools, then configures everything interactively.

> **Upgrading from an older version?** If you previously installed via `npx metaswarm init` (pre-v0.10.0), run `/migrate` in Claude Code to clean up old npm-installed files. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#upgrading-to-v090) for details.

Start your first task:
- Claude Code: `/start-task`
- Gemini CLI: `/metaswarm:start-task`
- Codex CLI: `$start`

Verify it worked:

```bash
ls .beads/knowledge/
# patterns.jsonl  gotchas.jsonl  decisions.jsonl  ...
```

Add your first knowledge entry:

```bash
echo '{"id": "pattern-001", "type": "pattern", "fact": "All API routes require authentication middleware", "recommendation": "Always add authMiddleware() to new route handlers", "confidence": "high", "tags": ["api", "auth"]}' >> .beads/knowledge/patterns.jsonl
```

## One-Shot Build: From Empty Repo to Working App

The fastest way to see metaswarm in action is to give it a project to build from scratch. Here's the full recipe.

### 1. Set up the project

```bash
mkdir my-new-app && cd my-new-app
git init
npm init -y        # or whatever your stack needs
```

Then open Claude Code and tell it to install metaswarm:

```text
> Read through https://github.com/richardfogaca/metaswarm and install it for my project.
```

Or install directly: `claude plugin marketplace add richardfogaca/metaswarm` then `claude plugin install metaswarm@richardfogaca-tools`, then run `/setup`.

### 2. Tell Claude what to build

Run `/start-task` with your spec. Include a tech stack, Definition of Done items, and where you want human checkpoints. The more specific the spec, the better the agents perform.

```text
/start-task I want you to build a real-time collaborative todo list with AI chat.

Tech stack: Node.js + Hono, React + Vite, SQLite via better-sqlite3,
Server-Sent Events for real-time sync, Anthropic Claude SDK for AI chat,
Vitest for testing.

Definition of Done:
1. Users can create, complete, and delete todo items via the UI
2. Todo items persist in SQLite and survive server restarts
3. Changes sync in real-time across multiple browser tabs via SSE
4. Users can chat with an AI assistant that can read and modify their todos
5. AI responses stream in real-time (not buffered)
6. All API endpoints have input validation
7. 100% test coverage on backend services
8. CI pipeline runs tests and lint on every push
9. Clean responsive UI that works on mobile

File scope:
- src/server/ — Backend API and SSE
- src/client/ — React frontend
- src/shared/ — Shared types
- src/server/**/*.test.ts — Backend tests

Use the full metaswarm orchestration workflow:
research the codebase, create an implementation plan, run the design
review gate, decompose into work units, and execute each through the
4-phase loop (implement, validate, adversarial review, commit).
Set human checkpoints after the database schema and after the AI
integration. When all work units pass, create a PR.
```

That's it. The orchestrator takes over:

1. **Research** — Scans your project, notes the tech stack from your prompt
2. **Plan** — Architect agent creates an implementation plan with work units
3. **Plan Review Gate** — 3 adversarial reviewers (Feasibility, Completeness, Scope & Alignment) validate the plan before it reaches the Design Review Gate
4. **Plan Validation** — Pre-flight checklist catches structural issues (missing service layer, wrong dependencies, oversized WUs) before spending agent cycles
5. **Design Review** — 6 agents review the plan in parallel (PM, Architect, Designer, Security, UX Reviewer, CTO)
6. **Decompose** — Breaks the plan into work units with DoD items and dependencies
7. **External Dependency Check** — Identifies required API keys/credentials and prompts you to configure them
8. **Execute** — For each work unit: implement with TDD, validate independently, adversarial review against DoD. Quality gates are blocking state transitions, not advisory.
9. **Checkpoints** — Pauses after schema setup and AI integration for your review
10. **Final Review** — Cross-unit integration check after all units pass
11. **PR** — Creates the PR and starts shepherding

### 4. Review at checkpoints

The orchestrator will pause at the checkpoints you specified. You'll see a report like:

```text
## Checkpoint: Database Schema Complete

### Completed Work Units
| WU   | Title              | Review          |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| WU-1 | Project scaffolding| Adversarial PASS|
| WU-2 | SQLite schema      | Adversarial PASS|

### What Comes Next
- WU-3: REST API endpoints
- WU-4: SSE real-time sync
- WU-5: AI chat integration

Action required: Reply to continue, or provide feedback.
```

Review what was built, give feedback if needed, then reply to continue.

### 5. Merge and ship

After all work units pass and the final comprehensive review is clean, the PR Shepherd monitors CI and handles any review comments. When everything is green, you merge.

### What just happened

In one prompt, metaswarm:
- Decomposed your spec into discrete work units with dependency ordering
- Implemented each unit with TDD (tests first, then code)
- Independently validated every unit (ran tsc, eslint, vitest itself — never trusted the coding agent)
- Had a fresh adversarial reviewer verify each unit against the spec with file:line evidence
- Paused for your review at the critical points you specified
- Ran a final cross-unit integration check
- Created and shepherded a PR

You described what you wanted. The system figured out how to build it.

### Tips for writing good one-shot specs

- **Be specific about DoD items.** "Users can create todos" is better than "todo functionality works." Agents verify exactly what you write.
- **Name your tech stack.** Don't make agents guess. Say "Hono + React + SQLite", not "pick a framework."
- **Set file scope.** Tell agents where code should live. This prevents sprawl and makes adversarial review effective.
- **Include user flows.** Describe what the user sees and does, not just what the code does. Include text wireframes if the app has a UI. This prevents building components that are never wired into the app.
- **List external dependencies.** If your app needs API keys (e.g., Anthropic, Stripe), say so in the spec. The orchestrator will prompt you to configure them before building features that depend on them.
- **Use human checkpoints.** Put them after risky or foundational work (database schema, auth, AI integration). You can always continue quickly, but you can't easily undo.
- **Start with a working spec, not a vague idea.** If you're not sure what you want yet, use `/brainstorm` first to refine the idea, then use the brainstorming output as your spec.

## The Pieces (Step by Step)

The rest of this guide walks through metaswarm's components individually. If you just ran the one-shot build above, you've already seen all of these in action.

## Step 2: Start Your First Task

Just run `/start-task` and describe what you want in plain English. No issue required.

```text
/start-task Add a webhook system that lets users register callback URLs
for events, with retry logic, signature verification, and a delivery log UI.
```

Pick something with real complexity — a new subsystem, a permissions layer, a reporting pipeline. Something that touches multiple files and needs real architecture. Then watch what happens.

This triggers the full pipeline:
1. **Prime** — Loads relevant knowledge for the task
2. **Research** — Explores your codebase for related patterns
3. **Plan** — Creates an implementation plan
4. **Plan Review Gate** — 3 adversarial reviewers validate the plan (Feasibility, Completeness, Scope & Alignment)
5. **Design Review** (if complex) — Runs the 6-agent Design Review Gate
6. **Implement** — TDD implementation
7. **Review** — Code review + security audit
8. **PR** — Creates PR with auto-shepherd

### Optional: BEADS Issue Tracking

For larger projects, you can create BEADS issues to track work formally. This is optional — `/start-task` works fine with just a plain English description.

```bash
# Create an epic
bd create "Add user profile page" --type epic --priority 2

# Create tasks under it
bd create "Research existing user data model" --type task --parent <epic-id>
bd create "Design profile API endpoints" --type task --parent <epic-id>
bd create "Implement profile service" --type task --parent <epic-id>
bd create "Build profile UI components" --type task --parent <epic-id>

# Add dependencies
bd dep add <design-task> <research-task>
bd dep add <implement-task> <design-task>
bd dep add <ui-task> <implement-task>

# Check what's ready to work on
bd ready

# Then start a specific tracked task
/start-task <task-id>
```

**Team Mode**: If multiple Claude Code sessions are active on the same repository, metaswarm automatically detects this and enables Team Mode with persistent teammates and direct inter-agent messaging. No configuration needed — see `guides/agent-coordination.md` for details.

**Development Guides**: The `guides/` directory contains 6 reference guides covering coding standards, testing patterns, git workflow, worktree development, build validation, and agent coordination. Agents load these automatically when relevant.

## Step 4: Try the Design Review Gate

For a more complex feature, trigger the parallel review manually:

```text
> /review-design docs/specs/my-feature.md
```

Six agents review in parallel:
- **PM**: Validates use cases and scope
- **Architect**: Checks service design and patterns
- **Designer**: Reviews API/UX design
- **Security**: Threat modeling (STRIDE)
- **UX Reviewer**: Verifies user flows, integration work units, and component wiring
- **CTO**: TDD readiness and alignment

Each produces an APPROVE/REVISE verdict. All six must approve, or the plan iterates (max 3 rounds before human escalation).

## Step 4.5: Orchestrated Execution (for Complex Tasks)

When your task has a **written spec with Definition of Done items** (e.g., after the Design Review Gate approves a plan), use orchestrated execution for rigorous, verified implementation.

The orchestrator breaks the plan into **work units** and runs each through a 4-phase loop:

```text
IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → ADVERSARIAL REVIEW → COMMIT
```

What makes this different from just "implement and review":

1. **Independent validation** — The orchestrator runs tests and type checks itself, never trusting the coding agent's self-report
2. **Adversarial review** — A fresh reviewer checks each DoD item with file:line evidence. Binary PASS/FAIL, not subjective quality assessment
3. **Fresh reviewers** — On re-review after failure, a new reviewer is spawned with zero memory of the previous review
4. **Human checkpoints** — Planned pauses at critical boundaries (schema changes, security code) where you review before the agent continues

**When to use it**: Multi-unit features with a spec, risky changes, anything where "it works, trust me" isn't good enough.

**When NOT to use it**: Single-file fixes, quick prototypes, tasks without a clear spec. For these, the simple task flow in Step 3 is the right choice.

See `skills/orchestrated-execution/SKILL.md` for the full pattern, and `rubrics/adversarial-review-rubric.md` for how adversarial reviews differ from standard code reviews.

## Step 5: Use Knowledge Priming

Before any task, prime your agent with relevant context:

```text
> /prime
```

Or with specific filters:

```bash
bd prime --files "src/api/**/*.ts" --keywords "authentication" --work-type implementation
```

This outputs prioritized knowledge:
1. **MUST FOLLOW** — Critical rules
2. **GOTCHAS** — Common pitfalls
3. **PATTERNS** — Best practices
4. **DECISIONS** — Architectural constraints

## Step 6: Set Up Coverage Enforcement

The `/setup` command configures coverage enforcement automatically. It creates `.coverage-thresholds.json` in your project root with your coverage command and thresholds.

When `.coverage-thresholds.json` exists, agents will be blocked from creating PRs or marking tasks complete until all coverage thresholds pass.

For details on the three enforcement gates, see [docs/coverage-enforcement.md](docs/coverage-enforcement.md).

## Step 7: Monitor a PR

After creating a PR, let the PR Shepherd monitor it:

```text
> /pr-shepherd 42
```

The shepherd:
- Monitors CI status
- Handles review comments
- Resolves threads
- Reports when ready to merge

## Step 8: Extract Learnings

After a PR is merged, extract learnings for the knowledge base:

```text
> /self-reflect
```

This analyzes recent PR review comments and suggests new knowledge entries for patterns, gotchas, and decisions.

## Customization

### Adding Your Own Agents

Create a new `.md` file in `agents/`:

```markdown
# My Custom Agent

## Role
Brief description of the agent's specialty.

## Responsibilities
- What this agent does
- What it produces

## Process
1. Step-by-step workflow
2. What to check
3. What to produce

## Output Format
Description of expected deliverables.
```

### Adding Rubrics

Create a `.md` file in `rubrics/` with scoring criteria that agents reference during reviews.

### Adding Knowledge

Append JSONL entries to the appropriate file in `knowledge/`:

```json
{"id": "gotcha-my-api", "type": "gotcha", "fact": "The payments API returns 200 even on failure", "recommendation": "Always check the response body status field, not HTTP status", "confidence": "high", "tags": ["payments", "api"]}
```

## Optional: Set Up External Tools

metaswarm can delegate work to Codex (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google) for cost savings and cross-model adversarial review. This is optional — skip this section if you only want to use Claude.

1. **Install** the CLIs:
   ```bash
   npm i -g @openai/codex @google/gemini-cli
   ```

2. **Authenticate** each tool:
   - Codex: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`
   - Gemini: run `gemini` once to log in with Google, or set `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - See [`templates/external-tools-setup.md`](templates/external-tools-setup.md) for full details

3. **Copy the config** into your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .metaswarm && cp templates/external-tools.yaml .metaswarm/
   ```

4. **Verify** everything works:
   ```text
   /external-tools-health
   ```
