# metaswarm

A self-improving multi-agent orchestration framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI. Coordinate 18 specialized AI agents and 13 orchestration skills through a complete software development lifecycle, from issue to merged PR, with recursive orchestration, parallel review gates, and a git-native knowledge base.

## What Is This?

metaswarm is an extraction of a production-tested agentic orchestration system. It has been proven in the field writing production-level code with 100% test coverage, mandatory TDD, multi-reviewed spec-driven development, and SDLC best practices across hundreds of PRs. It provides:

- **18 specialized agent personas** (Researcher, Architect, Coder, Security Auditor, PR Shepherd, etc.)
- **A structured 9-phase workflow**: Research → Plan → Design Review Gate → Work Unit Decomposition → Orchestrated Execution → Final Review → PR Creation → PR Shepherd → Closure & Learning
- **4-Phase Orchestrated Execution Loop**: Each work unit runs through IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → ADVERSARIAL REVIEW → COMMIT. The orchestrator validates independently (never trusts subagent self-reports), and adversarial reviewers check DoD compliance with file:line evidence
- **Parallel Design Review Gate**: 5 specialist agents (PM, Architect, Designer, Security, CTO) review in parallel with a 3-iteration cap before human escalation
- **Recursive orchestration**: Swarm Coordinators spawn Issue Orchestrators, which spawn sub-orchestrators for complex epics (swarm of swarms)
- **Git-native task tracking**: Uses [BEADS](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd` CLI) for issue/task management, dependencies, and knowledge priming
- **Knowledge base**: JSONL-based fact store for patterns, gotchas, decisions, and anti-patterns — agents prime from this before every task
- **Quality rubrics**: Standardized review criteria for code, architecture, security, testing, planning, and adversarial spec compliance
- **External AI tool delegation**: Optionally delegate implementation and review tasks to OpenAI Codex CLI and Google Gemini CLI for cost savings and cross-model adversarial review
- **Visual review**: Playwright-based screenshot capture for reviewing web UIs, presentations, and rendered pages
- **PR lifecycle automation**: Autonomous CI monitoring, review comment handling, and thread resolution
- **Workflow enforcement**: Mandatory quality gate intercepts at every handoff point — agents cannot skip design review, plan review, or knowledge capture
- **Context recovery**: Approved plans and execution state persist to disk via BEADS, surviving context compaction and session interruption

## Install

### 1. Install a host CLI

**Claude Code** ([official setup](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup))

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude
```

**Gemini CLI** ([official setup](https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/docs/get-started/))

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
gemini
```

**Codex CLI** ([official setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli))

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
codex
```

### 2. Install metaswarm into that CLI

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add richardfogaca/metaswarm
claude plugin install metaswarm@richardfogaca-tools
```

Then run `/setup` in Claude Code.

**Gemini CLI**

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/richardfogaca/metaswarm.git
```

Then run `/metaswarm:setup` in your project.

**Codex CLI**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardfogaca/metaswarm/main/.codex/install.sh | bash
```

Then run `$setup` in your project.

### Claude Official Directory

This repo now includes [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](/Users/richard/git/personal/metaswarm/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json), so `richardfogaca/metaswarm` works as a repo-hosted Claude marketplace immediately. To publish metaswarm in Anthropic's shared plugin directory, submit this plugin through Anthropic's form after validating it locally:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
```

Anthropic documents directory submission at `https://claude.ai/settings/plugins/submit` and `https://platform.claude.com/plugins/submit`.

### Cross-platform installer

After you install one or more CLIs, detect them and install metaswarm for all of them:

```bash
npx metaswarm init
```

### Start building

Run `/start-task` (Claude/Gemini) or `$start` (Codex) and describe what you want in plain English. No issue required.

```text
/start-task Add a webhook system with retry logic, signature verification,
and a delivery log UI.
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for prerequisites, platform-specific details, and migration from older versions.

## Temporal Runtime Development

The Temporal runtime now supports a local development stack:

- `npm run temporal:dev:up` starts local Temporal services with Docker Compose
- `npm run temporal:worker` starts the real host-side metaswarm worker
- `npm run temporal:dev:down` stops the local stack

See:

- [docs/temporal-dev.md](docs/temporal-dev.md) for the local runtime workflow and environment defaults
- [guides/temporal-runtime.md](guides/temporal-runtime.md) for the current runtime model
- [docs/plans/2026-04-08-temporal-runtime-design.md](docs/plans/2026-04-08-temporal-runtime-design.md) for the canonical Temporal design
- [docs/plans/2026-04-08-temporal-runtime-plan.md](docs/plans/2026-04-08-temporal-runtime-plan.md) for the implementation plan and phase record

## Self-Learning System

metaswarm doesn't just execute — it learns from every session and gets smarter over time.

### Automatic Reflection

After every PR merge, the self-reflect workflow (`/self-reflect`) analyzes what happened:

- **Code review feedback** — Extracts patterns, gotchas, and anti-patterns from reviewer comments (both human and automated) and writes them back to the knowledge base as structured JSONL entries
- **Build and test failures** — Captures what broke and why, so agents avoid the same mistakes in future tasks
- **Architectural decisions** — Records the rationale behind choices so future agents understand the "why", not just the "what"

### Conversation Introspection

The reflection system also introspects into the Claude Code session itself, looking for:

- **User repetition** — When a user corrects the same behavior multiple times or repeats instructions, this signals an opportunity for a new skill or command. The system flags these as candidates for automation.
- **User disagreements** — When a user rejects or overrides Claude's recommendation, the system captures the user's preferred approach as a knowledge base entry, so agents align with the user's intent in future sessions.
- **Friction points** — Repeated manual steps that could be codified into reusable workflows.

These signals feed back into the knowledge base and can generate proposals for new skills, updated rubrics, or revised agent behaviors.

### Selective Knowledge Priming

The knowledge base grows continuously, but agents don't load all of it. The `bd prime` command uses **selective retrieval** — filtering by affected files, keywords, and work type to load only the relevant subset:

```bash
# Only loads knowledge relevant to auth files and implementation work
bd prime --files "src/api/auth/**" --keywords "authentication" --work-type implementation
```

This means the knowledge base can grow to hundreds or thousands of entries without consuming context window. Agents get precisely the facts they need — the 5 critical gotchas for the files they're about to touch, not the entire institutional memory.

## Design Principles

1. **Knowledge-Driven Development** — Agents prime from the knowledge base before every task, reducing repeated mistakes
2. **Trust Nothing, Verify Everything** — Orchestrators validate independently (run tests themselves, never trust subagent self-reports), review adversarially against written spec contracts, and optionally use cross-model review via external AI tools
3. **Parallel Review Gates** — Independent specialist reviewers run concurrently, not sequentially
4. **Recursive Orchestration** — Orchestrators spawn sub-orchestrators for any level of complexity
5. **Agent Ownership** — Each agent owns its lifecycle; the orchestrator delegates, not micromanages
6. **BEADS as Source of Truth** — All task state lives in BEADS; agents coordinate via database, not messages
7. **Test-First Always** — TDD is mandatory, not optional. Coverage thresholds are enforced as a blocking gate before PR creation via `.coverage-thresholds.json`
8. **Git-Native Everything** — Issues, knowledge, specs all in version control
9. **Human-in-the-Loop** — Proactive checkpoints at planned review points, plus automatic escalation after 3 failed iterations or ambiguous decisions

## Acknowledgments

metaswarm stands on the shoulders of two key projects:

- **[BEADS](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)** by [Steve Yegge](https://github.com/steveyegge) — The git-native, AI-first issue tracking system that serves as the coordination backbone for all agent task management, dependency tracking, and knowledge priming in metaswarm. BEADS made it possible to treat issue tracking as a first-class part of the codebase rather than an external service.

- **[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** by [Jesse Vincent](https://github.com/obra) and contributors — The agentic skills framework and software development methodology that provides foundational skills metaswarm builds on, including brainstorming, test-driven development, systematic debugging, and plan writing. Superpowers demonstrated that disciplined agent workflows aren't overhead — they're what make autonomous development reliable.

metaswarm was created by [Dave Sifry](https://linkedin.com/in/dsifry), founder of Technorati, Linuxcare, and Warmstart, and former tech executive at Lyft and Reddit. Extracted from a production multi-tenant SaaS codebase where it has been writing production-level code with 100% test coverage, TDD, and spec-driven development across hundreds of autonomous PRs.
