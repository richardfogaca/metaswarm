## Choosing a Workflow

Not every task needs the full orchestration machinery. Use the right level of process for the task at hand:

| Task Type | Examples | Workflow | Key Skill |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick fix** | Typo, config change, copy update | Edit → test → commit | None needed |
| **Simple task** | Bug fix, small feature, validation | `/start-task` → simple flow | TDD only |
| **Complex task** (no spec) | New feature, refactor, optimization | `/start-task` → BEADS epic → linear implementation | Design Review Gate |
| **Complex task** (with spec & DoD) | Multi-unit feature, risky change, multi-agent work | `/start-task` → BEADS epic → orchestrated execution | **Orchestrated Execution** |

### Team Mode

metaswarm automatically detects **Team Mode** when multiple Claude Code sessions are active on the same repository (e.g., in different worktrees or terminals). In Team Mode, agents behave as persistent teammates with context retention across sessions and direct inter-agent messaging for coordination. Mode detection is automatic — no configuration needed. See `guides/agent-coordination.md` for the full Team Mode protocol.

**When to use Orchestrated Execution:**

- The task has a **written spec** with enumerable Definition of Done items
- The implementation involves **multiple work units** (3+ logical changes)
- You need **independent verification** — subagent self-reports aren't sufficient
- The changes are **high-stakes** (schema changes, security, new architectural patterns)
- You want **proactive human checkpoints** at planned review points

**When NOT to use Orchestrated Execution:**

- Single-file bug fixes or copy changes
- Tasks without a written spec or DoD items
- Quick prototyping or exploratory work
- Tasks where the overhead of decomposition exceeds the work itself

## Skills

Skills are orchestration behaviors that coordinate multiple agents.

### Orchestrated Execution

**Path**: `skills/orchestrated-execution/SKILL.md`

The 4-phase execution loop for rigorous, spec-driven implementation. Decomposes work into units and runs each through IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → ADVERSARIAL REVIEW → COMMIT.

- **Plan validation (pre-flight)**: Checklist catches structural issues (architecture, dependencies, API contracts, security, UI/UX, external deps) before design review
- **Work unit decomposition**: Break plan into discrete units with DoD items, file scopes, and dependency graphs
- **Independent validation**: Orchestrator runs tsc, eslint, vitest directly — never trusts subagent self-reports
- **Quality gate enforcement**: Gates are blocking state transitions, not advisory. FAIL means retry or escalate, never skip.
- **Coverage enforcement**: Reads `.coverage-thresholds.json` and runs the enforcement command. BLOCKING gate.
- **Adversarial review**: Fresh reviewer checks each DoD item with file:line evidence. Binary PASS/FAIL
- **Human checkpoints**: Planned pauses at critical boundaries (schema, security, external service credentials, new patterns)
- **Project context document**: Maintained by orchestrator, passed to each coder subagent to prevent context loss
- **Service inventory tracking**: `SERVICE-INVENTORY.md` updated after each commit to track services, factories, and shared modules
- **Final comprehensive review**: Cross-unit integration check after all units pass
- **Recovery protocol**: DIAGNOSE → CLASSIFY → RETRY (max 3) → ESCALATE with failure history

Uses the `adversarial-review-rubric.md` for reviews (distinct from the collaborative `code-review-rubric.md`).

### Design Review Gate

**Path**: `skills/design-review-gate/SKILL.md`

Spawns 6 agents in parallel to review a design document:

```text
/review-design <path-to-spec>
```

- PM, Architect, Designer, Security, UX Reviewer, CTO review simultaneously
- All 6 must APPROVE
- Max 3 iterations before human escalation
- Catches architectural issues before implementation begins

### PR Shepherd

**Path**: `skills/pr-shepherd/SKILL.md`

Autonomously monitors a PR through to merge:

```text
/pr-shepherd <pr-number>
```

- Polls CI status
- Fixes linting/type errors
- Responds to review comments
- Resolves discussion threads
- Reports when ready for human approval

### Handling PR Comments

**Path**: `skills/handling-pr-comments/SKILL.md`

Systematic workflow for addressing review feedback:

```text
/handle-pr-comments <pr-number>
```

- Categorizes comments by priority
- Addresses actionable items
- Marks out-of-scope items with rationale
- Resolves threads after addressing

### Plan Review Gate

**Path**: `skills/plan-review-gate/SKILL.md`

Validates every implementation plan through 3 adversarial reviewers before execution begins:

- **Feasibility Reviewer**: Assesses technical viability, dependency risks, and resource constraints
- **Completeness Reviewer**: Checks for missing work units, untested edge cases, and gaps in the Definition of Done
- **Scope & Alignment Reviewer**: Verifies the plan stays within the issue scope and aligns with codebase conventions

All 3 reviewers must APPROVE before the plan proceeds to implementation. Sits between the planning phase and the Design Review Gate in the workflow pipeline.

### External Tools

**Path**: `skills/external-tools/SKILL.md`

Delegates implementation and review tasks to external AI CLI tools (OpenAI Codex CLI, Google Gemini CLI) for cost savings and cross-model adversarial review:

- **Adapter protocol**: Uniform shell adapter interface (health, implement, review) with structured JSON output
- **Cross-model review**: Writer is always reviewed by a different AI model, eliminating single-model blind spots
- **Availability-aware escalation**: Model A (2 tries) → Model B (2 tries) → Claude (1 try) → user alert. Degrades gracefully with 0, 1, or 2 tools
- **Sandboxed execution**: Isolated git worktrees, minimal environment (`env -i`), timeout protection
- **Budget enforcement**: Per-task and per-session USD circuit breakers
- **Health checks**: `/external-tools-health` verifies installation, authentication, and reachability

Configuration: `.metaswarm/external-tools.yaml`. See `templates/external-tools-setup.md` for setup.

### Visual Review

**Path**: `skills/visual-review/SKILL.md`

Captures screenshots of web pages and UIs using Playwright for visual inspection and iteration:

- **Playwright screenshots**: Captures at configurable viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Reveal.js support**: Captures individual slides by hash navigation
- **Remote support**: HTTP file server for headless/SSH environments where `open` is unavailable
- **Review checklist**: Layout, typography, colors, spacing, content, responsiveness
- **Fix-and-recapture loop**: Make fixes, re-capture affected pages, verify visually

Prerequisites: `npx playwright install chromium`

}
```

### Knowledge Categories

## Coverage Enforcement

metaswarm supports configurable test coverage thresholds that block PR creation and task completion. This ensures agents cannot ship code that drops coverage below your project's standards.

### Setup

The `/setup` command configures coverage enforcement automatically. It creates `.coverage-thresholds.json` in your project root with your coverage command and thresholds.

For manual setup, copy the template to your project root:

```bash
cp templates/coverage-thresholds.json .coverage-thresholds.json
```

### Configuration

Edit `.coverage-thresholds.json` to set your thresholds and coverage command:

```json
{
  "thresholds": {
    "lines": 100,
    "branches": 100,
    "functions": 100,
    "statements": 100
  },
  "enforcement": {
    "command": "pnpm test:coverage",
    "blockPRCreation": true,
    "blockTaskCompletion": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `thresholds.lines` | Minimum line coverage percentage |
| `thresholds.branches` | Minimum branch coverage percentage |
| `thresholds.functions` | Minimum function coverage percentage |
| `thresholds.statements` | Minimum statement coverage percentage |
| `enforcement.command` | Shell command to run coverage (e.g., `pytest --cov`, `cargo tarpaulin`, `go test -cover`) |
| `enforcement.blockPRCreation` | If `true`, agents cannot create a PR until all thresholds pass |
| `enforcement.blockTaskCompletion` | If `true`, agents cannot mark a task complete until all thresholds pass |

### How Agents Use It

When `.coverage-thresholds.json` exists in the project root:

1. **Before pushing or creating a PR**, agents run the `enforcement.command`
2. If any threshold is not met, the agent **stops and fixes coverage** before proceeding
3. The task-completion-checklist enforces this as a blocking gate

### Single Source of Truth

Your test runner config (e.g., `vitest.config.ts`, `jest.config.js`, `pyproject.toml`) can read thresholds directly from `.coverage-thresholds.json` to avoid duplication. Example for Vitest:

```typescript
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";

const coverageConfig = JSON.parse(
  fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, ".coverage-thresholds.json"), "utf-8"),
);

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      thresholds: coverageConfig.thresholds,
    },
  },
});
```

This way both agents and CI enforce the same thresholds from a single file.

### Automated Enforcement Gates

Beyond agent checklists, metaswarm provides two automated enforcement mechanisms:

- **CI Job**: A GitHub Actions job template (`templates/ci-coverage-job.yml`) that reads and runs `enforcement.command` from `.coverage-thresholds.json`. Add it to your workflow to block merges on coverage failures.
- **Pre-push Hook**: A Husky-compatible hook (`templates/pre-push`) that runs lint, typecheck, format checks, and coverage enforcement before every `git push`. Configured automatically by `/setup` when `.husky/` exists.

See [docs/coverage-enforcement.md](docs/coverage-enforcement.md) for full setup instructions.

## Rubrics

Quality standards used by review agents:

| Rubric | Used By | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `code-review-rubric.md` | Code Review Agent (collaborative mode) | Style, patterns, error handling, testing |
| `adversarial-review-rubric.md` | Code Review Agent (adversarial mode) | Binary PASS/FAIL spec compliance, DoD verification with evidence |
| `architecture-rubric.md` | Architect Agent | Service design, coupling, scalability |
| `security-review-rubric.md` | Security Auditor | OWASP Top 10, auth, data handling |
| `plan-review-rubric.md` | CTO Agent | TDD readiness, completeness, alignment |
| `test-coverage-rubric.md` | Test Automator | Coverage, edge cases, mock quality |
| `external-tool-review-rubric.md` | Cross-model adversarial reviewers | Binary PASS/FAIL for cross-model review, file:line evidence |

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/beads-fetch-pr-comments.ts` | Fetch PR review comments from GitHub |
| `scripts/beads-fetch-conversation-history.ts` | Extract conversation history from Claude Code sessions |
| `bin/pr-comments-check.sh` | Verify all review comments addressed |
| `bin/pr-comments-filter.sh` | Filter actionable vs non-actionable comments |
| `bin/external-tools-verify.sh` | End-to-end verification of external tools setup (15 checks) |

## Workflow Phases

The full orchestration lifecycle:

| Phase | Agent(s) | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Research | Researcher | Codebase analysis, pattern inventory |
| 2. Planning | Architect | Implementation plan with tasks |
| 2a. External Dependency Detection | Issue Orchestrator | Identifies API keys/credentials, prompts user |
| 2b. Plan Validation | Issue Orchestrator | Pre-flight checklist (architecture, deps, API contracts, security, UI/UX) |
| 3. Design Review | PM + Architect + Designer + Security + UX Reviewer + CTO (parallel) | APPROVE/REVISE verdicts |
| 4. Work Unit Decomposition | Issue Orchestrator | Work units with DoD items, file scopes, dependency graph |
| 5. Orchestrated Execution | Coder (or External Tool) + Orchestrator + Adversarial Reviewer (per unit) | IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → ADVERSARIAL REVIEW → COMMIT loop (optionally delegates to Codex/Gemini) |
| 6. Final Comprehensive Review | Issue Orchestrator | Cross-unit integration check, full test suite |
| 7. PR Creation | Issue Orchestrator | GitHub PR |
| 8. PR Shepherd | PR Shepherd | CI fixes, comment responses |
| 9. Closure | Knowledge Curator | Knowledge base updates |

**Note**: For simple tasks without DoD items, phases 4-6 collapse into a linear implementation + code review flow. The orchestrated execution loop is only activated when the task has a written spec with enumerable DoD items.
